DST4L Comes to Copenhagen
-------------------------

What is the role of the librarian in the Digital Age? Will it evolve? And how?

Data Scientist Training for Librarians (DST4L) is an experimental course, started at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics John G. Wolbach Library and the Harvard Library to train librarians to respond to the growing data needs of their communities. Data science techniques are becoming increasingly important to all fields of scholarship. In this hands-on course, librarians learn the latest tools for extracting, wrangling, storing, analyzing, and visualizing data. By experiencing the research data lifecycle themselves, librarians develop the data savvy skills that can help transform the services they offer. Read more about the program here.

Thanks to Foster Open Science, the DTU Library and our contributors, DST4L is coming to Copenhagen. The course is free and open to beginners. Registration opens on June 3rd and closes on June 10th. Space is limited and acceptance will be based on the strength of your application. The course runs from September 9th to the 11th and an outline can be found here. Please review the schedule to see if you can commit to the program first before registering. If you cannot attend the course, material will be made available via the DST4L @ Copenhagen website as it progresses. The course will not be live streamed or recorded. You must be physically present for the course.
