### Reference

[Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) is the *MarkDown* flavour that is being used to write simple text pages. (The files the the extension: `.md`)

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is used to process the markdown and partial html pages into a complete website.

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) is used to host the website. 
Github knows about jekyll, so github will use jekyll to create the website everytime new commits are pushed to github.

[Universal bootstrap theme](http://universal.ondrejsvestka.cz/1-0/index2.html) is used for stylesheets and layout.
It is free and has been downloaded from [bootstrapious](http://bootstrapious.com/p/universal-business-e-commerce-template).
It should be relatively easy to copy-paste any layout component you see in the theme into the DST4L website. 
If you need this simply write your page in HTML (use `.html` as extension)


[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) is used by the Universal theme to do the layout. 
So if you have special layout requirements you may need to check the boottrap documentation. 
Also, any 
[CSS](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) and
[Component](http://getbootstrap.com/components/)
from Bootstrap should be easy to use in the DST4L website.
